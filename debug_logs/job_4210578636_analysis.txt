Weaknesses include a lack of clarity on salary and benefits, and a potentially high level of competition given the number of applicants.

3. Specific Requirements Match:
The job requires motivation, perseverance, excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, structure, and fluency in both French and English. German or Luxembourgish language skills are a plus.
